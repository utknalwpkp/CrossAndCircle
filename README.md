# CrossAndCircle
For now its less problematic. All well done with one part. When code found on a board double turn in AntiUser methods then dont create a turn.
But in compare to all issues it will be piece of cake.
All my code is in Beerware license, so If You liked and found me in some place good beer will be ok.
Regards for All!
